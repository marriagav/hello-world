# Hello World
My first GitHub repository, which includes some projects:
- A C++ snakes and ladders game that uses the concepts of OOP
- A python "Secret Santa" aplication that is friendly for the user. It sorts the secret santa's and sends an email to each participant with the details of the person that they need to gift to. 
- A python program that uses machine learning (KNN algorythm) to recommend movies

# A note about language
Some of these programs are in spanish, since it is my native language.
